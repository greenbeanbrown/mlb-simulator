# mlb-simulator
Simple program designed to simulate the outcomes of individual players and teams in a baseball game using a Monte Carlo simulation.

The program takes in some basic player statistics and provides a box score output for each simulation.

This simulation covers some basics, but there are a lot of assumptions made in this model (e.g. no double plays, no sacrifice hits, no pitching factor, etc..) and obvious enhancements that I will address before the next MLB season.
